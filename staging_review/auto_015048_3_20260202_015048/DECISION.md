# Final Decision

### Final Decision Summary:

The discussion focused on synthesizing Farnsworth's points about human-ai collaboration ethics and technical aspects of ensuring secure client instances. The key decision is to implement necessary module imports, error handling, and improve code documentation.

### Key Points Synthesized:

1. **Human-AI Collaboration Ethics**: Emphasized the need for a two-way street in AI collaboration.
2. **Technical Solutions**:
   - Import necessary modules (e.g., `openai`).
   - Use environment variables for API keys.
3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement try-except blocks to ensure secure and error-free functionality.
4. **Documentation**: Add docstrings for better code readability.

### Next Steps:

Claude will update the package to PyPI with the exact file path, add a comprehensive docstring, and suggest further updates to the __init__.py file as a follow-up.
