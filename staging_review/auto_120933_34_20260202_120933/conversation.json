Project Path\nYour project should be placed in a directory named \"deepseek\" within your Python project's root folder.\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p deepseek\ncd deepseek\n```\n\n### 2. Key Functions and Dependencies\n\n**Function for Extracting Features**\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom itertools import islice\n\ndef extract_features(image_batch):\n    \"\"\"Extract pixel values from an image batch into a feature vector.\n    \n    Args:\n        image_batch (list of list of tuples): Each sample has shape (height, width)\n        features: A tuple containing 'pixels' and 'labels'\n    \n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: Feature vectors extracted from the images\n    \"\"\"\n    pixels = []\n    for img in islice(image_batch, 0, len(image_batch)):\n        # Convert each pixel to an integer value between 0 and 255\n        img_array = [np.array(list(img)) for img in img]\n        \n        if features['pixels']:\n            pixels.extend([img_array])\n            labels = features['labels']\n            features['pixels'] = np.asarray(labels)\n    \n    return np.stack(pixels, axis=1)\n```\n\n**Dependencies to Import**\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom itertools import islice\n```\n\n### 3. Potential Issues and Solutions\n\n- **Dataset Availability**: Ensure the MNIST dataset is present in your project directory or obtain it from a public source.\n- **Data Formatting**: Verify that images are in the format (height, width) with pixel values as integers.\n- **Batch Handling**: Use `islice` to manage large batches efficiently.\n\n### 4. Testing\n\n```python\n# Test feature extraction on an empty batch\nbatch = islice(image_batch, 0, 5)\nfeatures = extract_features(batch)\n\n# Check that features['pixels'] is a numpy array with shape (num_images, height, width)\nprint(f\"Shape of pixels: {features['pixels'].shape}\")\n```\n\n### 5. Documentation\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nExtract pixel values from an image batch into a feature vector.\n    \nArgs:\n    image_batch (list of list of tuples): Each sample has shape (height, width)\n    features: A tuple containing 'pixels' and 'labels'\n    \nReturns:\n    np.ndarray: Feature vectors extracted from the images\n\"\"\"\n\n# This function is part of your deepseek package.

In this case, the file path is `deepseek/Python/extract_features.py`.\n\n2. **KEY FUNCTIONS**:\n   - `def extract_features(image_batch):`  \n     This function takes an array-like input representing image batch.\n     - Accepts both grayscale (2D) and color (3D) arrays.\n     - Extracts pixel values into a 1D numpy array in Fortran style (column-major order).\n\n3. **DEPENDENCIES TO IMPORT**:\n   - `numpy`: For numerical operations and array manipulation.\n   - `os`: For file handling.\n   - `itertools`: Optional, if additional functionality is needed.\n\n4. **POTENTIAL ISSUES AND HOW TO HANDLE THEM:\n\n- **Type Inconsistency**: Ensure that the input type is handled appropriately (e.g., using np.asarray or type checking).\n  \n- **Memory Issues**: When dealing with large images, consider reshaping to a 1D array and be mindful of memory usage.",

    "content": "### Implementation Plan for UI Enhancement: Display Notification for New Features\n\n#### Objective:\nImplement a simple UI notification feature to alert users about new features in the Farnsworth system.\n\n---\n\n### Files to Create:\n\n1. **farnsworth/ui/notifications.py**\n   - This file will handle the logic for displaying notifications.\n\n2. **farnsworth/web/static/js/notifications.js**\n   - JavaScript file to manage client-side notification display.\n\n---\n\n### Functions to Implement:\n\n#### In `farnsworth/ui/notifications.py`:\n\n1. **Function: `create_notification_message`**\n\n   ```python\n   from typing import Dict\n\n   def create_notification_message(feature_info: Dict[str, str]) -> str:\n       \"\"\"\n       Create a formatted message for the notification.\n\n       :param feature_info: Dictionary containing 'title' and 'description'.\n       :return: Formatted string message.\n       \"\"\"\n       return f\"New Feature: {feature_info['title']} - {feature_info['description']}\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Function: `send_notification`**\n\n   ```python\n   from fastapi import WebSocket\n\n   async def send_notification(websocket: WebSocket, feature_info: Dict[str, str]) -> None:\n       \"\"\"\n       Send a notification message to the connected client.\n\n       :param websocket: The active WebSocket connection.\n       :param feature_info: Dictionary containing 'title' and 'description'.\n       \"\"\"\n       message = create_notification_message(feature_info)\n       await websocket.send_text(message)\n   ```\n\n#### In `farnsworth/web/server.py`:\n\n1. **Function: `notify_new_feature`**\n\n   ```python\n   from fastapi import WebSocket\n\n   async def notify_new_feature(websocket: WebSocket, feature_info: Dict[str, str]) -> None:\n       \"\"\"\n       Notify connected clients about a new feature.\n\n       :param websocket: The active WebSocket connection.\n       :param feature_info: Dictionary containing 'title' and 'description'.\n       \"\"\"\n       await farnsworth.ui.notifications.send_notification(websocket, feature_info)\n   ```\n\n#### In `farnsworth/web/static/js/notifications.js`:\n\n1. **Function: `displayNotification`**\n\n   ```javascript\n   function displayNotification(message) {\n       // Display the notification message in a UI element (e.g., toast or modal).\n       alert(`New Feature Notification: ${message}`);\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **WebSocket Connection Handling**\n\n   ```javascript\n   const socket = new WebSocket(\"ws://localhost:8000/ws\");\n\n   socket.onmessage = function(event) {\n       displayNotification(event.data);\n   };\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Imports Required:\n\n- From `farnsworth/ui/notifications.py`:\n  - `Dict` from `typing`\n  - `WebSocket` from `fastapi`\n  \n- In `farnsworth/web/server.py`:\n  - Import the notification functions:\n    ```python\n    from farnsworth.ui.notifications import send_notification\n    ```\n\n---\n\n### Integration Points:\n\n1. **Modify `farnsworth/web/server.py`:**\n   - Add WebSocket endpoint for notifications.\n   \n   ```python\n   from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket\n\n   app = FastAPI()\n\n   @app.websocket(\"/ws\")\n   async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):\n       await websocket.accept()\n       # Example feature info to send as notification\n       feature_info = {\"title\": \"New Feature\", \"description\": \"Check out the new updates!\"}\n       await notify_new_feature(websocket, feature_info)\n   ```\n\n2. **Modify HTML Template:**\n   - Ensure `farnsworth/web/static/js/notifications.js` is included in the base template.\n\n---\n\n### Test Commands:\n\n1. **Run the FastAPI server:**\n\n   ```bash\n   uvicorn farnsworth.web.server:app --reload\n   ```\n\n2. **Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.**\n3. **Check for the notification alert pop-up indicating the new feature message.**\n\n---\n\nThis plan outlines the creation of a simple UI notification system within the Farnsworth architecture, ensuring users are promptly informed about new features using WebSockets for real-time updates.",
