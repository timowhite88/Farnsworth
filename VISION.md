# 👁️ Vision: Farnsworth

> "The architectural axioms and crystallized intent."

## Core Purpose
To create the ultimate "Connected Agent" that lives in your project and communicates with you anywhere.

Farnsworth transforms Claude from a tool into a persistent, evolving, and proactive companion that:
1.  **Remembers** everything (Memory System)
2.  **Acts** autonomously (Agent Swarm)
3.  **Collaborates** with you (Omni-Channel Messaging)
4.  **Evolves** to serve you better (Genetic Optimization)

## DNA (Tags)
`ai`, `assistant`, `agent`, `connected`, `deep-context`

## Domain Constraints
*Generated from architectural decisions*
- All state updates must propagate via the Nexus.
- Context is never static; it is projected.
- Privacy is paramount; all processing is local.
