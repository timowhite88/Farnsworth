# 🚀 Farnsworth Roadmap: The Spatio-Temporal Era

> "I've invented a machine that makes you read the Roadmap in my voice!" - Professor Farnsworth

This document outlines the evolutionary path of Farnsworth, from a memory-boosted assistant to a decentralized, spatio-temporal cognitive partner.

---

## 🛰️ Current Focus: Version 2.0.0 (Spatio-Temporal & Collective Intelligence)

We have entered the **Vision and Social** era. Farnsworth no longer just thinks; it *sees* action over time and *collaborates* across machines.

- [x] **Video v2.1: Advanced Flow Analysis** (`farnsworth/integration/video.py`)
  - [x] Farneback Optical Flow Action Detection
  - [x] Motion Magnitude Peak Keyframe Extraction
- [x] **P2P Swarm Fabric v2.5** (`farnsworth/core/swarm/p2p.py`)
  - [x] Multiplexed TCP Streams (The "Professorial" gossip protocol)
  - [x] Gossipsub & DHT-Lite for knowledge fragments
- [x] **Decentralized Knowledge Graph** (`farnsworth/core/swarm/dkg.py`)
  - [x] Federated edge updates between trust pools
  - [x] CRDT-based Last-Writer-Wins (LWW) conflict resolution
- [ ] **Planetary Memory**
  - Global shared vector cache (encrypted & anonymized)
- [x] **3D Scene Reconstruction** (`farnsworth/integration/vision/reconstruction.py`)
  - [x] Sparse Point Cloud generation via SfM (OpenCV)
  - [x] Fundamental Matrix & Trifocal Tensor estimation logic
