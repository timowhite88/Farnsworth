FORGE - Farnsworth Orchestrated Rapid Generation Engine
========================================================

A swarm-powered development orchestration system that uses multi-model
collective intelligence to plan, execute, verify, and ship code faster
and more reliably than any single-model approach.

Key Advantages:
- Multi-model deliberation (11 AI agents, not one)
- PROPOSE-CRITIQUE-REFINE-VOTE consensus on every plan
- 7-layer memory system (not fragile file state)
- Provider fallback chains (never blocked by one API)
- Built-in cost tracking and rollback
- Team coordination (not limited to solo dev)

"We don't plan alone. We forge together."
