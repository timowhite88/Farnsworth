"""
Upgrade Extractor - NLP analysis of swarm conversations to identify upgrade suggestions.

This module analyzes chat history to automatically detect when the swarm or users
suggest improvements, new features, or upgrades. These are then prioritized and
fed into the evolution loop as tasks.

Patterns detected:
- "we should add/build/implement..."
- "would be nice to have..."
- "let's upgrade/improve/enhance..."
- "need to fix/change..."
