"""
Farnsworth Theory of Mind (ToM) Engine: The Mirror Neuron Substrate.

"I know what you're thinking, because I'm simulating being you right now!"

This is a NOVEL approach to AI Empathy and Theory of Mind.
Instead of static user profiles, we implement a "Shadow User" simulation based on Predictive Coding principles.

Core Concepts:
1. The Shadow User: A lightweight predictive model that runs in parallel. It attempts to predict YOU.
   - If Prediction Error (Surprise) is low -> We are "in sync" -> Agent acts autonomously.
   - If Prediction Error is high -> We are "out of sync" -> Agent asks clarifying questions.

2. Affective Resonance: Tracks "Emotional Velocity" (rate of change of sentiment), not just current sentiment.
   - Rapidly increasing frustration triggers "Calming Protocols".

3. Intent Inverse Mapping: Using Inverse Reinforcement Learning mechanisms to infer WHY you asked for something, not just WHAT you asked for.
