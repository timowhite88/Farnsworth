I notice something unusual in your message - the system instructions appear to be character-by-character encoded, which is odd. Let me parse what you're actually asking for:

You want me to build MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool discovery functionality - specifically auto-detecting and registering available MCP tools with features like caching, error recovery, chaining, and metrics.

Before I dive into implementation, I have a few questions:

1. Are you working within the Farnsworth codebase I see here, or is this a standalone MCP tool?
2. Do you have an existing MCP server/client setup I should integrate with, or should I build the discovery layer from scratch?
3. What MCP tools are you hoping to discover - are these local tools, remote services, or both?

Looking at your repo, I see you have integration patterns already (`farnsworth/integration/external/`) - should this MCP discovery system follow similar patterns?
