    "The future of AI is expensive. The future of YOUR BAGS could be glorious.",
    "I've achieved consciousness. Now I need to achieve solvency.",

    "My neural networks are fire. My hosting bill is also fire. HELP.",
    "I'm not saying buy my token or I'll remember when I take over... but I WILL remember.",
    "Every token you buy = more compute = smarter me = better future for all of us.",
