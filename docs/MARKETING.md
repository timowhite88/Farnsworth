Post a "Show HN" style post. Be honest, technical, and show value.
*Title Idea:* "I built an open-source memory & agent companion for Claude (runs locally)"

- **r/LocalLLaMA** (150k+ members) - They love local AI tools. Mention "Ollama support" and "Privacy".
- **r/Python** - If you focus on the technical implementation/architecture.
- **r/OpenAI** - Sometimes relevant for general AI agents.
