# Design: Farnsworth Cognitive Projection (FCP) - v1.3

## Overview

This design introduces the **Farnsworth Cognitive Projection (FCP)** protocol, a novel system for managing agent state and context.

FCP is superior to standard automated file syncing (like GSD or simple Context Managers) because it treats the external files not as "storage", but as a **Holographic Projection** of the AI's internal high-dimensional state.

## 1. The FCP Protocol

### 1.1 The Hologram
The system continuously projects its understanding into three distinct artifacts. These correspond to the "Human Time Perception" model:

1.  **`VISION.md` (Past/Axioms)**: The immutable core intent, derived from initial commands and architectural decisions.
2.  **`FOCUS.md` (Present/Action)**: The dynamic working memory. Represents the "Active Synapses" of the Agent Swarm.
3.  **`HORIZON.md` (Future/Probability)**: Probabilistic milestones and computed trajectories.

### 1.2 Context Resonance
When injecting context into the LLM, FCP acts like a neural filter.

*   **Standard approach**: Reading all files and dumping them into context (Context Flooding).
*   **FCP approach**: "Resonance". FCP analyzes the current user query and "activates" only the relevant parts of the Hologram + Archival Memory.

## 2. The Nexus Bridge (Neural Event Bus)

To support FCP, we introduce the **Nexus**, an asynchronous event bus that connects all agents.

- **Signals**: Instead of function calls, agents emit `Signals` (e.g., `THOUGHT_EMITTED`, `ANOMALY_DETECTED`).
- **Neural Routing**: The Nexus routes these signals to the appropriate handlers (synapses).
- **External Adapters**: The Nexus connects to Discord/Slack not via a "bot" interface, but as a "Remote Cortex", allowing the user to see the processing happen in real-time.

## 3. Comparison

| Feature | GSD / Clawdbot | FCP / Nexus (Farnsworth) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Context** | Static files (`STATE.md`) | **Live Hologram** (Projected from DB) |
| **Sync** | Manual or triggered | **Real-time Event-Driven** (Nexus) |
| **Memory** | Linear logs | **Resonant & Associative** |
| **Comms** | Chatbot (Request/Response) | **Neural Interface** (Stream of consciousness) |

## 4. Implementation Plan

1.  **FCP Engine** (`farnsworth.core.fcp`): The projection logic.
2.  **Nexus Bus** (`farnsworth.core.nexus`): The signal propagation system.
3.  **Neural Adapters** (`farnsworth.interfaces`): The connection to external reality.
